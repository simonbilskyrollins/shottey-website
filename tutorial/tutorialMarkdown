## Game setup

When creating a new game you have the ability to track one team or both teams.

#### One Team Tracking

One team tracking means that you will only be tracking one of the teams. You
will still need to [manually change the score](#manually-changing-score) if the
second team scores a point, but you do not have to set up their rotation.

#### Two Team Tracking

While tracking all the hits for both teams may be impossible on one iPad, two
team tracking enables you the option of recording hits for the second team if
you want.
In addition, setting up the second team's rotation (the main difference between
one team and two team tracking) gives you access to their rotation at any point!

## Shot Tracking

#### Manually Changing Score

When a point ends from something other than a [kill](#kill), [tool](#tool), or
[error](#error) you will need to manually increase the score by tapping the
arrows next to the score.

#### Switching Sides

<img src="/images/screenshots/switch_rotate_undo.png" width="400" />

In the middle of the third or fifth set the teams switch sides, but for your
convenience you can press the Switch Sides button at any time.

The Switch Sides button is in the upper right corner above the
[Manual Rotate](#manual-rotate) button.

#### Manual Rotate

While it should be considered a last resort option to using the [Undo](#undo)
button, if the rotations get off you can force Shottey to rotate using this
button.
Tapping the button will bring up an alert that allows you to select the team
(if you are [Two Team Tracking](#two-team-tracking)) and the direction you would
 like to rotate.

 <img src="/images/screenshots/manual_rotate.png" width="400" />

The Manual Rotate button is located in the upper right corner of the screen
below the [Switch Sides](#switching-sides) button.

#### Undo

The undo button will remove the most recent event from
[Event History](#event-history) and update accordingly.
If the most recent event resulted in a score change ([kill](#kill),
[tool](#tool), [error](#error)) the undo button will also remove the score
change event.

<img src="/images/screenshots/switch_rotate_undo.png" width="400" />

The undo button is located in the upper right of the screen.

#### Toggle vs Overlay
There are two different ways you can distinguish between
hard/soft hits and serve/transition hits.

1. Toggle: When appropriate, change the toggles in the upper left corner from
their default states (hard and transition hits) while logging each hit.

2. Overlay: The overlays require you to decide if the hit was hard or soft

  <img src="/images/screenshots/hard_overlay.png" width="400"/>

  and if the hit was off of serve receive every time you track a hit.

  <img src="/images/screenshots/serve_overlay.png" width="400"/>

  In the settings panel you have the ability to decide whether or not
  you would like to see the overlays.

#### Track Shots

The structure for tracking shots is as follows:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap where the ball went

Shottey automatically classifies the type of hit as
[Kill](#kill), [Live](#live), [Tool](#tool), [Block](#block), [Error](#error)
based on the various locations of the hits.

##### Kill

To record a kill:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap the opposite side of the court in bounds* where the ball went
4. Tap the Kill radius button that appears where you tapped in Step 3


*If you tap out of bounds Shottey will classify the hit as an [Error](#error).

##### Live

To record a live ball:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap the opposite side of the court in bounds* where the ball went
4. Tap anywhere in bounds* except the black kill button. The exact location of
third tap will not be kept, it is only to distinguish classify the hit as Live
rather than [Kill](#kill).

*If you tap out of bounds Shottey will classify the hit as a [Tool](#tool).

##### Tool

To record a tool:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap the opposite side of the court in bounds* where the other team contacted
the ball. Usually this will be close to the net since tools are typically
touched by the player blocking
4. Tap where the ball went out of bounds

*If you tap out of bounds Shottey will classify the hit as an [Error](#error).

##### Block

To record a block:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap the opposite side of the court in bounds* where the other team contacted
the ball (typically at the net)
4. Tap in bounds** where the ball went after being blocked

IMPORTANT: Recording a block does not change the score. Shottey does not
differentiate between blocked shots that result in a point and those that do
not. If a team scores from a block be sure to
[Manually Change the Score](#manually-changing-score).

*If you tap out of bounds here Shottey will classify the hit as an
[Error](#error).

**If you tap out of bounds here Shottey will classify the hit as a
[Tool](#tool).

##### Error

To record an error:
1. Tap the player who hit the ball
2. Tap the location where the player contacted the ball
3. Tap where the ball went: out of bounds or tap anywhere on the same side of
the court as Step 2

#### Event History

The event history is located at the bottom of the screen. The events are
displayed in chronological order from left to right.

##### Hit Event

<img src="/images/screenshots/event_hit.png" width="150" />

The player is on the left and the abbreviation for the type of hit is on the
right.

Tapping a hit event will show that hit on the court.

##### Score Change Event

<img src="/images/screenshots/event_score.png" width="150" />

The left team is on the left and the right team is on the right. The team that
scored is in green.

Tapping a score change event will show all the hits from that point on the
court.


##### Substitution Event

<img src="/images/screenshots/event_sub.png" width="150" />

The player coming out is on the left and the player coming in for them is on the
 right.
